## Chunk 1

- What aspect of Chunk 1's work did you find the most difficult?
  - The most difficult part of chunk was figuring out the layout & CSS for my resume. I used several templates which were already styled, but that didn't feel genuine. So I ended up finding a resume format that I liked and decided to recreate that myself. I used CSS grid to provide the layout. Once I had the layout, it was easy to fill in the info. As far as deploying the static website, I had plenty of experience using S3, CloudFront and Route 53 to host websites from preparing for the SAA & CDA certifications so that part was pretty straight forward for me.
